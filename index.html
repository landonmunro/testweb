    <h3>Introduction
    </h3>
    <p>I am Landon Munro and I am a senior here at Lewis University. My major is finance with a minor in economics. I have two older brothers, one of 
        <br>which goes to lewis as well. For my parents, my father is a carpenter and my boss as well which has its ups and downs and my mom is a teacher
        <br> at a middle school.

    <h3>What I hope to Learn in this Course</h3>
    <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
        <li>The basics on how computer systems work</li>
        <li>Learn programs that are new and develop new skills that they involve</li>
        <li>How to better access and store files on a computer</li>
      </ul>
<h3>My Favorite Hobby / Activity
</h3>
<p>My favorite hobby is working on my vehicles as I just find it enjoyable to be able to put something back together after taking it apart.
    <br>When I take my truck off-road, it is bound to break something on it and because of this, I would not be able to continue to pay someone
    <br>everytime it broke. So my way of getting around this issue is just to learn and try it myself.

<h3>Fun Fact
</h3>
<p>A fun fact about me is that I go deer hunting every year and missed one this year with my bow because I was shaking too much!</p>
